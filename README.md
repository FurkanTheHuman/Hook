# Hook Note Taking App

After some angry days of trying and failing some note taking programs I concluded that note taking is hard.
I wanted to write a program that "just works!(tm)".

# Notes to my self
### how ironic
UI is problem. Not like I am going to write some fancy shit
but the design of interaction some times unclear.
To understand it:
	* it is git like
	* when I create or edit a node vim opens up
	* this shit can be any other editor that is suitable 
	* other than that it just terminal based.

### <b>Examples</b>

hook new "my ideas"
	opens up vim  for "my ideas" at root 
hook edit ideas
	opens if no sub node exists else asks interactivly
hook delete ideas
	deletes from data file but creates a recovery file 
	and at some point deletes that too



at some point I want to show everything at the browser
but for now not necessary
hook server 
also remote stroage can be efective


IDEA: like git there is no global stuff 
but but hear me out you usually don't need more than one source
so that is easier
